here is a guide for my codes:

login.html & login.css & script.js => for register(login)form ans POST user information to firebase DataBase.

index.html & index.css & app.js => for fetching all the datas(including user profile)and give the ability to DELETE and PUT(update / edit) user information.

and i chose same background image for both sources to show the connection between two projects :)
